This is a web based remote control for iTunes, written before Apple released the iOS Remote app. It uses the Ruby AppleScript bridge to get song information and control iTunes.

It was made entirely as a proof of concept in 2008, and is not guaranteed to work with current versions of iTunes. I had just discovered the rb-appscript gem and Apple had recently released DashCode, so I decided to play around and see what I could do with the both of them.
